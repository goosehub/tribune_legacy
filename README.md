The Third Incarnation of Tribune

This project uses codeigniter as a php frameword, however it does not depend on it, and anybody that can write css, javascript, or php is encouraged to participate.


The root directory is named tribune. The config, controller, model, and view is found under application, and resources are under the root directory. 

I will be adding more information to this file soon.
