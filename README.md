The Third Incarnation of Tribune

Anybody that can write css, javascript, php, or english is encouraged to participate.

This project uses Bootstrap as a CSS framework. There is some overriding taking place in the style file.

This project uses CodeIgniter as a PHP framework, but does not depend upon it. It is mostly used for the clean URL's and MOdel-View-Controller, with some form_validator help as well.

This project uses Active Record for secure and easy Database Interactions. It is easy to understand, even without explanation.

The images folder is empty, but needed to receive uploads.

The index file in the root is simply a redirect.

The controller News, the news_model, and the style.css file is most of the programming.

The View is split into pages (about), templates (header and footer), and news (index, view, categories, contribute, and success).

The config folder only holds the routes.php file, because that is the only one you'll have to edit. It is used to provide the clean URL's.

The rest of the information you need should be commented in the code.
